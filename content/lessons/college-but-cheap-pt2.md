## (Re)Introduction

I'll waste no time! This is part two of series where I compare what I've learned in college and those courses with what I think are one-to-one comparisons. Same format as part one, each course will have a free and paid option, where the paid option has some sort of certificate attached with it. Let's continue!

Listed below are the courses I took my junior and senior year of college. You will notice there is more emphasis on theory and design patterns this last half. These courses will really solidify your knowledge in computer science, and even though they don't pop up too often in day-to-day tasks, they are that 'secret handshake' of CS.

### Year Three (Junior Year)

- â€¢ CS-260: Computational Models
- â€¢ CS-440: Database Management
- â€¢ CS-360: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

### Year Four (Senior Year)

- â€¢ CS-370: Programming Languages
- â€¢ CS-460: Security in Application
- â€¢ CS-490: Senior Project

#### **CS-260: Computational Models**

**Free:** <u>[Brooklyn College: Lectures by Noson Yanofsky](https://youtu.be/OS33r2Fk8YQ?si=77x91cu-rB-raISE)</u>

**Paid:** No paid options!

Computational Models, or theoretical computer science, was a course I didn't expect to like, but did. It was challenging, but it really is one of those courses that every computer science student should take. No web framework, no dependencies, just theory. We weren't even allowed laptops during lecture, just pen, paper, and the whiteboard. It takes some getting used to, but the problems you solve require more then just another library.

The reason there's likely no certificate or paid option for this course, is that the degree is the paid option. This subject is really embedded in academia, so if you'd like to study a career here, a PHd would be your best bet!

I've talked with Professor Yanofsky over the phone some months back, he is an incredibly smart mentor. If you get the chance, check out his book <u>The Outer Limits of Reason: What Science, Mathematics, and Logic Cannot Tell Us</u>, where he dives deeper into sizes of infinity and set theory.

#### **CS-440: Database Management**

**Free:** <u>[Database Fundamentals: Full Course](https://youtu.be/mhsp1SSiugk?si=SSsIEPU74jlTgRox)</u>

**Paid:** <u>[Database Engineer Professional - Meta](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer) - Cost: $49 / month </u>

These courses are great for some trying to get into more backend and infrastructure, as having the right database for your application in such a key component. In this course, you'll cover a lot of terminology such as RAID, dead locks, relational vs. non-relational databases. If you're serious about getting into backend development and database management, I would highly recommend the paid option because it is designed to move you into such a role.

<br><br>

#### **CS-360: Advanced Data Structure's and Algorithms**

**Free:** <u>[Playlist: Advanced Data Structure's and Algorithms - Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JUN9aDxVmI&list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uP4rJgf5ayhHWgw7akUWSf)</u>

**Paid:** <u>[Python Data Structure's and Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-algorithms-python/) - Cost: $14</u>

Probably the most difficult course I took in college: most of my assignments were in that 750 - 1500 lines of code range. That said, this course really builds upon what you learned in CS-160 and is ideal for anyone getting into computer science academia. I have never came across any of these data structures in an interview setting, as usually they are so time consuming to write that it would take a while to implement.

#### **CS-370: Programming Languages**

**Free:** <u>
[Playlist: Programming Languages - Brown University](https://youtu.be/3N__tvmZrzc?si=cfQ_hk8MpR1hGudg)
</u>

**Paid:** <u>
[Build A Complete Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-languages-build-an-interpreter/)
</u>

As I'm writing this, I'm currently enrolled in this course! From what I've gathered so far, it's a really great way to get more exposure to how languages work and to try out some new languages. Use this time to explore and build your own language in some new language! This course touches on both theory and practical applications, and is a good opportunity to do some low level work as well.

{{< alert title="Additional Resource!" type="success" >}}
This is the <u><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html">online textbook</a></u> we are currently using in class. In this course, we are building and expanding the Lox programming language, which is built using Java. I would recommend following along this book and maybe using a different language to prevent just copying and pasting everything.

#### **CS-460: Security In Application**

**Free:** <u>
[Cybersecurity Free Learning and Resources - IBM ](https://skillsbuild.org/students/course-catalog/cybersecurity)
</u>

**Paid:** <u>
[Cybersecurity Professional - Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) - $49 / month
</u>

Cybersecurity is a huge industry and is growing need as we advance in this technological era. This is another point where I would recommend the paid option if you are serious about getting into security. It's a really popular course and one of the major benchmarks employers look for when applicants apply for security positions.

<br>

#### **CS-490: Senior Project**

<br>
{{< alert title="Choose your own adventure!" >}}
For my college's senior project course, you really get to decide on what you want to build! The top choices are usually web app, mobile app, desktop app, or game, with the top choice being a web app. This section is opinionated, so feel free to branch off and use the knowledge you have to build something new!

</u>

This is it! Your last computer science course, time to use what you've learned over the last four years or so (hopefully shorter). In the is course, there's even more flexibility! You can build a game, try out a new library or framework, or study something with more theory involved. Some of the major requirements, however, is to use some tool to do: version control, communication (if there's team members), CI/CD pipeline, tests, and some form of deployment.

For my senior project, I worked on a team of four and we built a mobile and web platform called Feathr. There was a lot that went into the platform: a backend server, cloud functions with Firebase, a web and react native frontend, testing for all platforms, deployment, and CI/CD pipeline. Checkout my projects page to learn more.

You did it!! ðŸ¥³ you have now completed a 1-to-1 computer science degree. I know that was a lot, and a lot of stuff that's not even necessary to get a job. But now you've done the secret handshake. And you did it on your own time, for a lot less. There's a lot to be said there, so congratulations!

Feel free to contact me on your thoughts on how I did on this list, I would love to hear your perspective! Thanks you for sticking around!
