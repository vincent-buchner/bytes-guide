# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vincent!
Chances are that if your on this page you:

- A. Mis-clicked
- B. Are Lost
- C. My Mom
- D. All the above (sorry, mom)

But in the off chance that you arn't one of those options, **hello and welcome!** This is my hybrid-portfolio-resume-blog thingamabob. At the time of writing this, I'm not quite sure what it'll be. Could be a blog, could just be an online resume, or just another side project that gets the boot. Who's to say? But what I will say, regardless of what it may be, is that I'm proud of it. I made it. I learned it. I brought it to life. That, fundamentally, is what drew me to programming: creation. Sure, other developers may have a more advanced platform (not to mention the drag-n-drop website editors), but I like my 'ugly' creation. This is something that, to me, can not be taken away. There's not an amount of rejection emails or AI hype that will rob me from the pride I have for this project.

Any who, that was a lot of the brain! But I hope it gives you a sense of what I want this project to be and what I want to bring to the table. With that, check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) if your curious about my experience or go to the [home page](/home) if you want to explore more. Scroll around and let me know what you think: I don't *byte*! Get it? Okay, I'll stop...
