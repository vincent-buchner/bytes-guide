*Launch. Okay here we go!*

## A Space for Building, Learning, and Sharing

*Bytes Guide* is my little slice of the web: a combination portfolio, resume, and blog that I've built myself to learn, build, and share what I'm learning as I go. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're interested in what I've been doing, what I'm learning, or maybe just looking for some tech writing that isn't like reading robot-generated documentation. Either way, you're welcome.

The site itself is built with <u>[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)</u>, a fast, flexible static site generator that I chose for the primary reason of how little friction it adds to writing. I paired it with Tailwind CSS in order to have complete control over styling without needing to reinvent the wheel on layout or responsiveness. Everything here should be straightforward, clean, and snappy, regardless of whether you're on a laptop, a phone, or something in between. 

## Why I Built This

As is common with most developers, I was collecting side projects, tutorials, and concepts into messy folders, GitHub repos, and abandoned documents. *Bytes Guide* was one way of establishing some order amongst that mess. I wanted to have a site that was not just a resume, but rather a living log of what I'm making and learning. It's half-portfolio, half-dev blog, and half-public notebook: basically a site I can continue to grow. I use it as a sandbox to play with ideas, try new tools, and explore in ways that I can't always do on a day job or class project.

## What You'll Find Here

The site is split into a few primary sections:

- **Portfolio**: Here I emphasize the projects I've builtâ€”apps like *Feathr*, *Driftcode*, *Rate My Caf*, and even this site itself. I usually include background on why I built them, how they work, and what I have learned.

- **Blog**: My favorite section. These are the posts where I dig into specific tools, design patterns, or technical deep-dives that I've found fascinating enough to write about. If I hit a roadblock and solve it, the odds are good that I'll write about it here.

- **About**: A quick summary of who I am, what I'm about, and how I ended up learning how to program in the first place.

- **Experience**: An exhaustive list of my work experience, encompassing internships and work at companies like *Mayo Clinic* and *Personafy*.

## The Bigger Picture

Ultimately, I don't want this to be a static portfolio that I update yearly. I want it to be an active, evolving place to visit and discover new things. Whether that's through writing, projects, or sheer curiosity, *Bytes Guide* is where I experiment in the open.

It's not perfection. It's being developed in public. And if I post something here that enables another human to learn faster, debug sooner, or build better, then that's a win.

I created it. I learned it. I made it work. That, ultimately, is what made me fall in love with programming: **building cool stuff.**.
