I just bought a brand new mechanical keyboard, the <u>[EPOMAKER Split65 QMK/VIA](https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-Programmable-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Ergonomic/dp/B0DP48X8F7?th=1)</u>, to be exact. It's my first look into mechanical keyboards, and I'll admit that I'm quite excited. I've never owned one, never swapped switches or messed with firmware. But after a bit of research (okay, more than a bit), I thought it was time.

The Split65 is an ergonomic keyboard with a split layout, which means the keys are divided into two separate halves. It’s supposed to be better for posture and reduce wrist strain, especially during long coding sessions. And while I’ve only been using it for a short time, I’m already starting to understand why so many people are into this kind of setup. The typing is more intentional, more physical, and frankly, more pleasant. For something I'm using every day, it's been a surprisingly energizing switch.

That being said, I'm not going to be that guy. The obnoxiously loud keyboard in a quiet office, clacking away like a woodpecker. I'll be using this at home, where the only person I can annoy is myself.

And don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to be some kind of keyboard evangelist either. A keyboard is a keyboard. I didn't buy this because I think it types me more quickly or because I want people to ask me questions about my gear. I bought it because it was cool, and because I'm graduating in the near future and thought I'd treat myself to a small gift that's personal and useful.

But then after I was going to look into doing research on which one to purchase, I came across this entire subculture that I was completely unaware of. There are entire communities: subreddits, forums, even Discord servers—dedicated just to mechanical keyboards. People post photos of their setups, debate switch type, and show off builds that likely cost more time and money than I am willing to consider. It's kind of amazing.

What surprised me was how personal a keyboard could be. Just like cowboy hats take on the shape of the individual, a keyboard seems to have some sort of personality for developers. One is subtly different from another: different layouts, switch type, keycap profile, and even sound profile. Some opt for aesthetics, some for feel, others for ergonomics or travel. In a peculiar kind of way, it reminded me that what we use to build also says quite a bit about how we see ourselves.

All that aside, I still think it's a bit pretentious to try too hard on that. Like, sure, maybe your keyboard is customized to you, but at the end of the day, it's still a keyboard. It's easy to get caught up in the gear and forget what the gear is actually being used for. And if someone tells me that their $300 setup makes them a better coder, I'm going to quietly raise an eyebrow.

Seriously, keyboard braggers are sort of like that group of kids on the playground who assured everybody that their new shoes would make them run faster. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't: but it was never really about the shoes, was it? It was about being cool, about believing you had something new and shiny that set you apart.

I suppose I'm attempting to do the middle ground. I don't want to personalize my keyboard into a personality, but I do enjoy the aspect of appreciating that I get to build something that's like mine. There's something cool in itself about building it personalized: picking keycaps, maybe flashing with new firmware, experimenting with layouts. It's a miniature hobby in a large hobby.

Eventually, though, the largest thing is just to write code. The keyboard is an instrument, not a destination. If it keeps you comfortable, focused, and maybe brings a dash of joy to the work, that's fine. But if you find yourself talking more about your keyboard than what you're building with it, then it's worth investigating.

So, yeah, I got myself a mechanical keyboard.
