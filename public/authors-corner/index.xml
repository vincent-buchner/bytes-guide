      <title>The Mechanical Keyboard Rabbit Hole</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just bought a brand new mechanical keyboard, the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-Programmable-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Ergonomic/dp/B0DP48X8F7?th=1&#34;&gt;EPOMAKER Split65 QMK/VIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, to be exact. It&amp;rsquo;s my first look into mechanical keyboards, and I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I&amp;rsquo;m quite excited. I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned one, never swapped switches or messed with firmware. But after a bit of research (okay, more than a bit), I thought it was time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Split65 is an ergonomic keyboard with a split layout, which means the keys are divided into two separate halves. It’s supposed to be better for posture and reduce wrist strain, especially during long coding sessions. And while I’ve only been using it for a short time, I’m already starting to understand why so many people are into this kind of setup. The typing is more intentional, more physical, and frankly, more pleasant. For something I&amp;rsquo;m using every day, it&amp;rsquo;s been a surprisingly energizing switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>This Post Is Nothing (That’s the Point)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of boilerplate code. Widgets and components ready to be used with something. That&amp;rsquo;s how a good portion of this site started out to begin with too. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to be even more critical and say, that&amp;rsquo;s what this post is. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing really. No new ideas or thoughts. A filler, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But although it is a placeholder, I still need to put something in it. What is that going to be? AI-generated text, lorem ipsum, the script from the Bee Movie? Not really a challenge, but something to consider. We&amp;rsquo;ve leaned so heavily on filler content to keep the process going: mock data, scaffolding, templates. So long as it holds the form, it&amp;rsquo;s doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
