      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of boilerplate code. Widgets and components ready to be used with something. That&amp;rsquo;s how a good portion of this site started out to begin with too. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to be even more critical and say, that&amp;rsquo;s what this post is. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing really. No new ideas or thoughts. A filler, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But although it is a placeholder, I still need to put something in it. What is that going to be? AI-generated text, lorem ipsum, the script from the Bee Movie? Not really a challenge, but something to consider. We&amp;rsquo;ve leaned so heavily on filler content to keep the process going: mock data, scaffolding, templates. So long as it holds the form, it&amp;rsquo;s doing its job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
